    <h2>What is a GEEP</h2>
    <p> A geep is a domestic sheep-goat hybrid, even if look similar and in the same family having a geep is rare, why? <br> It's because they're from an entirely different genus from another! </p>
    <h3>An Unordered list of Fun Facts About Them</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The genus that sheeps are from is <i>Ovis</i>, while the genus goats are from is <i>Capra</i> </li>
        <li>The genus <i>Ovis</i> has 54 chromosomes while the genus <i>Capra</i> has 60 chromosomes </li>
        <li>The geep hybrid is different from a sheep-goat chimera, the latter are artificially created by combining the embryos of a goat and sheep unlike being mated.</li>
        <li>They are also known as a Shoat</li>
    </ul>
